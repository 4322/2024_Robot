+button hold down if slow (robot coordinator likely)
+unwind (extend) sequential w/ pivot (hold down)
+rewind (retract)
+maybe controller rumble? can't remember
-set all the constants
-configure climber motor
+shuffleboard variables: read position of climber + set voltage
+end command if at/above max (if at, ENTER TOLERANCE IMMEDIATELY) and vice versa for other way
+left bumper is retract, right bumper is extend
+fix extend like i did in comment- 
+add new state to outtake (climbing)
+make slowretract firing solution
+for isFinished, have it return false- they can try to go up all they want
-there should be some sort of decorator that you pass in that allows you to override reverse soft limit (maybe set reverse soft limit enabled)
+don't make it dependent on pivot being in position (climber extended)
+slow retract, fast retract, fast extend (slow retract button, left trigger)
-change climber gear ratio (wtf)
